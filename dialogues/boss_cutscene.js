const boss_cutscene_dialogue_text = "\\General Fang: Well hello there Mr. Phil. You and I finally meet.\nIt was wise of you to not open fire when you saw me first.\n\\Telvy Phil: What... Are you?!\n\\General Fang: You seem to be forgetting who you are talking to.\nI am General Fang. The person who is running this facility from its beginning days.\nJust... A bit different from how everyone remembers me due to... uncalculated radiation damages...\n\\General Fang: Platonia Facility, the world's most active nuclear facility to this date.\nAt least... Until now...\n\\Telvy Phil: What happened? How did this place explode?\nI just entered the facility through the entrance and I was locked in.\nThey tell me you have the master keycard.\nWe need to destroy this place and get out of here. If the radiation spreads out,\nit will be another Chernobyl Incidient.\n\\Telvy Phil: They told me you have the control room keycard as well.\n\\General Fang: Yes I do have both of them, Mr. Telvy Phil.\nJust give me some time to talk and we'll decide what to do.\n\\Telvy Phil: Talk?! This place is filled with mutants! Get us out of here!\n\\General Fang: Just listen to me Telvy. Don't piss me off. I'm your general.\nI know you are the hero of this story so far. But you need to listen to my words.\nBecause this isn't about this facility anymore... It is much more...\n\\Telvy Phil: What are you even talking about?!!!!\n\\General Fang: What you see is freedom, Telvy. A new way of life... Survival...\nPeople have been researching for centuries to find a way of immortality...\nAnd here we are... Platonia Experiment Delta...\n\\Telvy Phil: Experiment Delta? What is that?\nI have no clue why are you saying these now that\nwe are on the edge of the radiation taking over everywhere.\n\\General Fang: You see, you don't see the vision. let me explain myself.\nThis has been the most helpful humanity's creation so far...\n\\Telvy Phil: But how? What is so helpful about it?\n\\General Fang: I'm glad you asked...\nExperiment Delta exercises radiation and its effects in the most interesting way.\nUsing radiation, subjects will become like nothing seen before.\nMutation in certain organs of the body allows for eternal life of one being.\nYou will see a whole different colony in the world that rises and is immortal.\nNo more aging and becoming old.\n\\General Fang: The radiation will have long lasting effects.\nAs for some, they will die in the way of this expermient to allow for growth for others.\nAnd others will thrive and rise as they become immortal.\n\\Telvy Phil: But isn't this cruel?!\nYou want people to die this easily?!\n\\General Fang: IN EVERY IMPORTANT EVENT OF OUR HISTORY OF ANY SPECIES...\nTHERE WERE CASUALTIES.\nHOW DARE YOU SAY THAT?!\n\\Telvy Phil: Okay... Didn't mean to piss you off like that...\n\\Telvy Phil: I listened to you enough.\nWhere are the keycards?\n\\General Fang: The keycards oh yeah...\nHere is the Master Keycard. Just pick it up and go.\nIf you want the control keycard you are not getting it\nunless you get over my body.\nYou can leave peacefully if you agree with me or want to leave this facility alone...\nHumanity needs a chance to redeem itself. This is the chance.\n\\General Fang: However if you decide to fight me to get the control room keycard\nAnd try to be the hero of the story, you will pay for it.\n\nLeave or fight me...\nYour choice.\n\\";

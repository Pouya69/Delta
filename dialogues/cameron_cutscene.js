There are others outside.\nWhat are you doing here..?\n\\Cameron: I'm hiding.. From those things outside..\n\nWhy are you here?\nHow did you find me?!\n\\Telvy Phil: I came here from the entrance section.\nGustavo sent me.\nHe said you know more about what happened around here.\n\\Cameron: S..STOP IT...\nOkay, this all happened so quickly.\I was tasked to open the valve at the power room.\nGeneral Fang had it under control until... The blast.\nI think he is dead. We haven't heard of him since...\nSince then we are all trying to hide from them mutants...\n\\Telvy Phil: What the heck?! Didn't General Fang do any checks before turning the valve?!\nWhat kind of valve was it?\n\\Cameron: It was the reactor valve.\nI was with Roman.\nHe knows more about what happened after General Fang's line cut out.\n\\Telvy Phil: Where is he then?\nHow do I get to him?\nI need a way to deal wioth the radiation.\n\\Cameron: Roman's still in the power control room.\nYou might want to start looking there.\nHowever try to look around the storage area.\nSearch for a hazmat suit. It'll help you A LOT. You won't survive without it.\n\\Telvy Phil: off my go then.\n\\Cameron: WAIT.\nTake this flashlight. Without it you won't see anything. The lights are cut out over there.\n(Press and hold [F] to use flashlight when the environment is dark)\nTake it and... Good luck...\n\\Telvy Phil: Thanks...\n\\";

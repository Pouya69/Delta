What happened?!\nYou were the only person that was with General Fang before the incident.\nWhat the heck happened?!\n\\Pouya: The heck am I supposed to know?!\nFang told me to get out of the reactor room because his\ncomms wasn't working. He told me to go grab someone else for some help.\n\\Telvy Phil: Help? with what?\n\\Pouya: The freaking experiment he was yapping about all the time.\nHe really had a full vision for it.\nAfter I left, about a while as I was on my way here\nI heard the explosion. It was freaking scary man.\nThe whole place shook down. I dropped down and broke my arm.\n\\Telvy Phil: Sorry to hear that. So no one was with General Fang when it happened?!\nDoing an experiment all by himself?!\n\\Pouya: He didn't even tell me he was gonna do it.\nHe told me to grab some help.\nProbably was just tinkering around and boom.\n\\Telvy Phil: Where is he now then?!\n\\Pouya: Last time he was in the reactor room.\nHe's dead because I haven't heard of him since.\nAnd that much radiation after the explosion should have killed him already.\n\\Telvy Phil: What are we supposed to do then?!\nWe wanna get out of here.\n\\Pouya: There is only one way.\nI have the Reactor Area Keycard.\nGo and grab a hazmat suit from there.\nIt will really help you. Try and find General Fang's body.\nThe reactor room is not that big.\nGeneral Fang has the Master Keycard.\n\\Telvy Phil: What does that do?\n\\Pouya: Getting us out of here for God's sake?\nAlso...\nFang had the Control Room keycard as well.\nIf you can pick it up and go to the Control Room,\nYou can activate the self destruct mode.\n\\Telvy Phil: Self Destruct mode?!\nYou wanna blow this place up?!\n\\Pouya: We don't have any other choice Telvy!!!\nThis place should be contaminated and disappear from the face of this planet.\nGo and activate it and we'll be gone by then.\nYou hurry up and also get to the entrance to get the heck out before this place\nblows up.\n\\Telvy Phil: Okay... Can you give me the Reactor Area Keycard?\n\\Pouya: There are 3 lights in the reactor room.\nIf they turn off make sure to turn them back on.\n\nHere take my keycard. Hurry. We're counting on you.\n\\";
